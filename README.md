# Document Retrieval Program

## About

This program asks for a directory of text files (for instance, you can try your directory of notepad files), then a word to search for, and finally returns a list of files that that word is found in, ranked by relevance. 

## How to Run

This program was written with Java. In order to run, please do the following from the command line (make sure you have Java installed):

- Compile with "javac *.java"
- Run with "java Main"

You'll do this from the root folder that you stored these files in.
